## Based on the assigned question from exercise, we have added some sub-questions to specifically explore different aspects

Here is an overview of changes and work distribution of all members on the questions:

1. [What is the dependence in Europe on fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas)?]() [Milan]
   1. What is the current share of fossil fuels in Europe's total energy consumption
   2. How does the reliance on fossil fuels vary across different European countries
2. [How has this developed over time?]() [Milan]
   1. What role have major geopolitical events (e.g., the 1973 oil crisis, the fall of the Soviet Union, etc.) played in shaping Europe's fossil fuel dependence?
   2. How has Europe’s energy mix shifted from domestic coal production to importing fossil fuels from other regions (e.g., Russia, the Middle East)
3. [What are the main uses of fossil fuels in Europe?]() (Anum)
   1. Which industries (e.g., power generation, manufacturing, transport) are the biggest consumers of fossil fuels in Europe?
   2. What proportion of oil, coal, and natural gas is used for electricity generation versus transportation or heating?
4. [What effect does the change in price of fossil fuels have on their use?]() | Paul |
   1. Have recent price increases in energy (e.g., due to geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions) led to shifts in energy sourcing or consumption in Europe?
5. [What are the main sources of fossil fuels used in Europe and how have these changed since the 2000s?]() [ Kartik ]
   1. Which countries are the largest suppliers of oil, natural gas, and coal to Europe
   2. How has Europe’s reliance on imported fossil fuels evolved in recent years, particularly with the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on energy imports? Is a trend visible in the data?
6. [How well are countries in Europe moving toward the goal of reducing fossil fuel use?]()
   1. Has the agreement on climate strategies (eg. the EU’s Green Deal or the Paris Agreement) had a significant influence on the reduction of fossil fuel dependence? (Anum)
   2. Which countries in Europe are leading the way in reducing fossil fuel consumption, and which are lagging? [ Kartik ]
   3. Have there been events in recent history that delayed the phase-out of fossil fuels? [ Kartik ]
   4. What are the main obstacles that European countries face in achieving their fossil fuel reduction targets (e.g., economic factors, political challenges, infrastructure limitations)? (Anum)
